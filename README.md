# ezExp
This plugin to Unity is a way to produce quick experiments without worrying about back end tasks. It proposes to deal with init files containing formatted information like the ones produced by [TouchStone](https://www.lri.fr/~appert/website/touchstone/touchstone.html). It will save results during the whole experiment fluently.

## TODO
- Test trial class
- Load and Record data (first .csv then could be interesting to have some .xml and .json)
